# Introduction

Calculating persistent homology presents a computationally expensive challenge, particularly for large and high-dimensional datasets.
Ripser, a C++ library, addresses this obstacle and significantly reduces processing time and memory usage compared to contemporary persistent homology engines [@ripser].
Although Ripser calculates persistent homology of a Vietoris-Rips complex, other libraries have built upon its foundation [@cubicalripser; @flagser; @lockfreeripser; @ripserpp].
With the increasing popularity of persistent homology, wrapping Ripser and related engines in the R programming language [@rlang] would permit easier incorporation into data analysis and machine learning pipelines.
Here, we introduce `ripserr`, an R package that wraps the Ripser and Cubical Ripser C++ libraries, allowing efficient persistent homology computation of Vieoris-Rips and cubical complexes.
