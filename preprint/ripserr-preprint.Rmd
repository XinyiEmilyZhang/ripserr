# Introduction

Calculating persistent homology presents a computationally expensive challenge, particularly for large and high-dimensional datasets.
Ripser, a C++ library, addresses this obstacle and significantly reduces processing time and memory usage compared to contemporary persistent homology engines [@ripser].
Although Ripser calculates persistent homology of a Vietoris-Rips complex, other libraries have built upon its foundation [@cubicalripser; @flagser; @lockfreeripser; @ripserpp].
With the increasing popularity of persistent homology, wrapping Ripser and related engines in the R programming language [@rlang] would permit easier incorporation into data analysis and machine learning pipelines.
Here, we introduce `ripserr`, an R package that wraps the Ripser and Cubical Ripser C++ libraries, allowing efficient persistent homology computation of Vieoris-Rips and cubical complexes.

# `PHom` S3 class

When incorporating persistent homology in R pipelines, we must consider the best container to hold persistence data.
`ripserr` uses the `PHom` (portmanteau of persistent homology) S3 class to manage persistence data.
Note that more complex forms of persistence (e.g. extended persistence [@ext-persist]) are not discussed.

At its core, the `PHom` class simply encompasses a data frame storing persistence feature details.
Each data frame row represents a single feature and each column represents a single feature property.
Structurally, the data frame within a `PHom` object has three columns named `"dimension"`, `"birth"`, and `"death"` (in that order) of class `integer`, `numeric`, and `numeric`, respectively.
Although `PHom`-specific S3 generic methods have been implemented, users may also benefit by using `data.frame`-specific S3 generic methods; for this reason, `PHom` objects have class `PHom` and `data.frame`.

To get a better intuition for `PHom` objects, the following code blocks demonstrate the class's basic functionality.
