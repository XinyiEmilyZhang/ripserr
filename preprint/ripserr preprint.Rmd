# Introduction

Calculating persistent homology via a Vietoris-Rips complex presents a computationally expensive challenge, particularly for high-dimensional datasets.
Ripser, a C++ library, addresses this obstacle and significantly reduces processing time and memory usage compared to other available persistent homology libraries [@ripser].
Although Ripser calculates persistent homology of a Vietoris-Rips complex, other libraries have taken advantage of its general technique to calculate persistent homology of cubical complexes [@cubicalripser], directed flag complexes [@flagser], or to provide other functionality [@lockfreeripser; @ripserpp].
With increasing use of persistent homology, effective incorporation of Ripser and Ripser-based engines in data analysis pipelines would serve a useful purpose.
The R programming language [@rlang] has been popular with data scientists [@cite-something
Here, we introduce `ripserr`, a software package that wraps Ripser and Ripser-based C++ libraries to calculate persistent homology in the R programming language.
